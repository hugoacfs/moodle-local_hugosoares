Synergy Task

Thanks for taking time to go through this. I didn't have a lot of time to go over things as I would before marking something as ready for production, but it would be good enough to be peer reviewed perhaps.

Also I haven't worked with Moodle 4 yet, and in fact, I have been working solely with Totara for a long time, so I was a bit rusty finding the best ways of doing certain things.

The most challenging thing was the completion status. I haven't had to work with that side of the db in the past or any APIs relating course completion, and for the sake of time I went with that worked instead of what might be best practice.

All the best,

Hugo Soares
